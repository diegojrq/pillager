edit password: see if a controller is a solution
http://railscasts.com/episodes/274-remember-me-reset-password

#primary

privacy for all (see validate_path_hack)
clean the controllers: admin/nonadmi

#communities

search
send the invitation
listing of users must show the owner
make them privatable, so searchs wont find them. make the show/id blockable
make them searcheable

#users

sex (edit/new) bugged: somthing on colection at _form
make them searchable
think of a way to add friends, so onlly friends can invite to communities. this way friends can be searchble

#roles

#validate_path_hack

one validate_path_hack for each controller?
